# Ruby-Monopoly

# Game rules

* The map details are provided in board.json:
  
* There are four players who take turns in the following order:
  * Peter
  * Billy
  * Charlotte
  * Sweedal
* Each player starts with $16
* Everybody starts on GO
* You get $1 when you pass GO (this excludes your starting move)
* If you land on a property, you must buy it
* If you land on an owned property, you must pay rent to the owner
* If the same owner owns all property of the same colour, the rent is doubled
* Once someone is bankrupt, whoever has the most money remaining is the winner
* There are no chance cards, jail or stations
* The board wraps around (i.e. you get to the last space, the next space is the first space)
